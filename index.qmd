## What is Artificial Intelligence ? {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .shrink}
One of the earliest definitions of __AI__ could be traced back to [John McCarthy](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf):

> the science and engineering of making intelligent machines
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .shrink}
[the European Commission](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206) is currently defining __AI__ as:

> a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, generate output such as predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing physical or virtual environments
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .shrink}
[Google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence) defines __AI__ as: 

> a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
[Stuart J. Russell](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-we-need-to-rethink-the-purpose-of-ai-a-conversation-with-stuart-russell) defines __AI__ as:

> building machines that do the right thing, that act in ways that can be expected to achieve their objectives

> [Tom M. Mitchell](https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/lecture-notes/stat479fs18/01_ml-overview_slides.pdf): a computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$

## :bulb: Breakthrough 1: foundation models

![](img/foundation-models.png){fig-align="center" height=350}

:school: [Foundation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf) is a paradigm shift in the AI research from developing task-specific models trained on narrow data to developing multi-purpose models trained on broad data

:tongue: Large language models (__LLMs__) could be viewed as a subset of foundation models that deal only with text

## :bulb: Breakthrough 2: winning recipe for training 

Zeroing in on :trophy: _the winning recipe_ for building __a good foundation model__: 

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\begin{array}{c}
\textit{winning recipe} \\
= \\
\textbf{huge amounts of easy to acquire data} \\
\times \\
\textbf{a simple, high-throughput way to consume it}
\end{array}
}
\end{equation}

## :bulb: Breakthrough 2a: self-supervised learning

![](img/denosing-auto-enc.png){fig-align="center" height=450}

:scroll: Originally conceived in the [1980s](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/), revived in [2008 by researchers at the University of Montreal](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~larocheh/publications/icml-2008-denoising-autoencoders.pdf) and popularised by the [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) in 2018

:dart: Aims to reconstruct the input or predict missing parts of the input

## :raised_hand: What does pre-training learn ?

While language modelling appears simple, it is a very powerful technique to learn a wide range of things since input sequences can contain any type of information, for example:

```python
# Example 1: Syntax
"The quick brown fox jumps <mask> the lazy dog"

# Example 2: Trivia / Knowledge
"Newcastle University is located in <mask>"

# Example 3: Sentiment
"I've never laughed so much during a trip to the cinema. The Barbie movie was <mask>"

# Example 4: Coreference
"Will Ferrell stole the show in this movie. <mask> is such a good actor"

# Example 5: Mathematics
"I was thinking about the sequence that goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, <mask>"
```

![](img/a-pile-of-books.jpg){fig-align="center" height="600" width="700"}
:::

The data used to pre-train language models is usually obtained from the internet, for example:

- [Big Science Corpus](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigscience/BigScienceCorpus?source=wudaocorpora)
- [Pushshift Reddit Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08435.pdf)

__Transformers__ are particularly successful due to:

- __attention__: captures contextual relationships between words, allowing to understand the importance of each word in the context of the entire input
- __positional encodings__: retains information about the order of words in the input sequence, enabling effective handling of sequential information
- __parallel computation__: can process the entire input sequence simultaneously, making them computationally efficient and enabling faster training and inference unlike sequential nets (e.g. RNNs)

![](img/gpt3-paper.png){fig-align="center" height=400}
:::

::: {.column width=65%}
In 2020, [Brown and colleagues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) report the following:

> Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora

## :bulb: Breakthrough 3: scaling-up 

![](img/scaling-laws.png){fig-align="center" height=275}

In 2020, [J. Kaplan and colleagues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) demonstrated that the performance of Large Language Models appears to improve with scaling:

- __compute__
- __data__
- __model size__

## :link: GenAI value chain

[McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/what-every-ceo-should-know-about-generative-ai) describes an emergence of a following __value chain__:

## :womans_clothes: Patterns for developing GenAI applications 

![](img/sewing-patterns.jpg){fig-align="center" height=350}

Currently, most interesting GenAI applications leverage __LLMs__ and seem to follow one of the three main patterns:

1. __chatbot__
2. __retrieve & generate__
3. __agent / assistant__

## :slot_machine: Pattern 1: "chatbot" {auto-animate="true"}

![](img/chatbot-pattern.png){fig-align="center"}

LLMs generate responses to users' inputs without any external knowledge

## :slot_machine: Pattern 1: "chatbot" {auto-animate="true"}

![](img/chatbot-pattern.png){height=150 .absolute right=0 top=0}

:::{style="margin-top: 100px"}
While this is the simplest pattern, it is usually effective for a wide range of standard __natural language processing__ tasks, including:

- summarisation
- translation
- sequence / token classification
- generating conversation text
:::

However, __hallucinations__ can be a notable problem

## :shirt: Pattern 2: "retrieve & generate" {auto-animate="true"}

![](img/rag-pattern.png){fig-align="center"}

LLMs generate responses to users' inputs by:

- __retrieving__ most relevant data from an external source
- __augmenting__ query with retrieved data
- __generating__ response based on augmented query

## :shirt: Pattern 2: "retrieve & generate" {auto-animate="true"}

![](img/rag-pattern.png){height=125 .absolute right=0 top=0}

:::{style="margin-top: 100px"}
This pattern is currently used as a solution to limited context windows and  hallucinations. 

It is usually effective for tasks focussing on __information retrieval__ and __question answering__

# :moneybag: Business implications

## :briefcase: Leveraging GenAI models in your organisation {.smaller}

![](img/business-cat-wide.jpg){fig-align="center" height=300}

Before you start, the following [key questions](https://huyenchip.com/2023/06/07/generative-ai-strategy.html) should be considered: 

- __If I don’t do anything__: 

    - can competitors using GenAI models make me obsolete ?
    - will I miss out on opportunities to e.g. boost revenue ?

- __If I do something__: 

    - what are the risks ?
    - what are the costs ? 
    - what are the benefits ?

## :bookmark: Understand key behaviours / dealbreakers of GenAI models {.smaller}

When working with GenAI models, it is good to be mindful of the following:

- __ambiguity of inputs and outputs__:
    - how do we ensure consistency ?
- __hallucination vs factuality__:
    - does it matter ?
    - if so, how do we ensure that the generated content is factual ?
- __context length__:
    - a significant proportion of information seeking questions have context-depends answers 
- __forward and backward compatibility__:
    - how do we ensure that your prompts work with the newer model versions ?
- __cost at inference time__:
    - can we afford to use LLMs for our use case ?
- __efficiency of chat as a universal interface__:
    - is chat the right interface for our use case ?

1. train a model from scratch 
2. adapt a model in-house through:

    - prompt engineering
3. build software layers on an open-source model API
4. build software layers on a closed-source model API
5. use a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool
